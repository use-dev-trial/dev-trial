# DevTrial

## Overview

A coding assessment tool that helps to screen large volumes of candidates.

LeetCode-style assessments are becoming unreliable for mass screening because candidates can cheat with LLMs to instantly solve traditional problems without understanding them. DevTrial combats this by shifting from generic algorithm questions to realistic coding challenges that require deeper reasoning, integration, and decision-making—areas where AI alone struggles without human input. This ensures a more accurate evaluation of a candidate’s real-world coding skills, even in an AI-assisted world.

## Comparison to LeetCode

### Ease of Test Design

DevTrial offers a whole suite of AI tools that allows companies to quickly create problem scenarios, boilerplate code, and test cases.

### Ease of Stack-Ranking Candidates via Numeric Scores

DevTrial allows companies to quickly verify AI-generated tests, as well as configure more subjective coding standards to judge the candidate's responses.

## User Perspectives

### From the Candidate’s Perspective (Arena)

DevTrial functions similarly to Coursemology, where candidates submit code in pre-defined files within a test environment. Upon clicking "Run Tests," pre-defined test cases will be executed against their code. Candidates will then receive the results of visible/hidden test cases.

### From the Company's Perspective (Forge)

DevTrial is similar to ChatGPT, where a chatbot helps you build the initial scaffolding of the problem scenario. The chat-based UI evolves as the conversation dives deeper into technical details. Possible (P2) features include an IDE for engineers to directly write code and more complex UI components that assist in problem scenario development and test suite creation.

## Target Customers (in Order of Priority)

### 1. Startups Without Entrenched Assessment Pipelines, but with a Strong Technical Team

Many startups receive a high volume of applications but lack the engineering bandwidth for extensive face-to-face interviews. They are more receptive to alternative assessment tools that screen directly for job-readiness. These companies have enough technical expertise to define the required candidate skills and can take a proactive role in designing problem scenarios and test suites.

### 2. Startups Without Entrenched Assessment Pipelines and Without a Strong Technical Team

DevTrial's problem scenario and test suite creation must take on more responsibility in inferring the company's requirements, as these companies may not be able to articulate technical details. Test suite creation must also be highly accurate due to minimal human verification.

### 3. Big Companies with Entrenched Assessment Pipelines (e.g., HackerRank as Their First Screen)

While these companies are frustrated with AI-enabled cheating, their entire talent pipeline is already built around HackerRank assessments. DevTrial needs to be significantly better than HackerRank to convince them to migrate away from their existing formats.
